# SynthCoTrain 
Co-Training for Crystal Synthesizability Prediction
## Intoroduction
SynthCoTrain is a materials-informatics package which predicts the synthesizability of crystals. The nature of the problem is a semi-supervised classification, in which we access only to positively labeled and unlabeled data points. SynthCoTrain does this classification task by combining two semi-supervised classification methods: Positive and Unlabeled (PU) Learning and Co-training.
The classifiers used in this package are the ALIGNN https://github.com/usnistgov/alignn and the SchNetPack https://github.com/atomistic-machine-learning/schnetpack.
## Installation
Inline code: `print("Hello, World!")`

```python
# Code block
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
```
